I have used TestNG  for unit testing as it provides tools for structured, modular and data based tests. With
DataProvider I can build clear tests with a defined set of input and expected behaviour. Mockito helped to mock
elements of Players objects (random and scanner) to focus the test on the getMove.

The application flow starts asking the user info needed to start a particular mode. The mode itself asks specific info
like the difficulty (you may want to have different AI for different modes). Then there is the game loop with the
gamemanager using two players to return the result of the round. For single mode one player will be a Human player, the other
will be the bot. Notice that in case of a multiplayer mode, the class will still work. Result is printed for a specific round
and at the end of the game as well.

I consider the code pretty clear and not needed of many comments.
